### 2. Gameplay Mechanics

#### 2.1 Core Gameplay
Players are presented with **two side-by-side images**: one original and one AI-reconstructed. The objective is to:
- Identify the real image
- Spot inconsistencies in AI-reconstructed images
- Highlight specific areas that appear artificially generated

#### 2.2 Scoring System
- **Correct choice:** +Points based on difficulty
- **Wrong choice:** Lose streak/multiplier
- **Speed Bonus:** Faster correct answers grant more points
- **Streak System:** Consecutive correct answers build a score multiplier
- **Expert Accuracy:** Bonus for correctly pinpointing AI-reconstructed areas

#### 2.3 Game Modes
- **Classic Mode:** Identify the real image before time runs out.
- **Endurance Mode:** Play until three mistakes are made, with increasing difficulty.
- **Spot the Difference:** Mark AI-generated inconsistencies instead of selecting an image.
- **Expert Mode:** Uses medical images or X-ray reconstructions for a technical challenge.
- **Multiplayer Mode:** Compete in real-time against other players.

### 3. Progression & Rewards
